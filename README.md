# ResNet50
Aim is to build very deep convolutional networks, using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), allow you to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.

**Steps:**
- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets. 
- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification. 

We build ResNet 50 model and use it to perform Image Classification on SIGNS dataset.
